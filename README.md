# PredictingWineQuality
#This R Notebook uses a variety of machine learning models such as random forest, decision tree, boosted decision tree, naive bayes and neural networks to predict highly correlated variables to determine whether a student heavily consumes alcohol on the weekend. 
#The best model was the random forest model where I prioritize the recall score with 95%. This measurement is best for identifying alcohol consumption in students because it is important to minimize the number of false negatives.
